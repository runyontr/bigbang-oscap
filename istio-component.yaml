          Istio provides network isolation between components in the Kubernetes cluster based on
          the SPIFFE/SPIRE of the component and how they apply to the AuthorizationRules defined
          in the system.

          Istio provides least privilege between components by having a granular view of the 
          identities of workloads in the cluster and being able to apply granular 
          AuthorizationPolicies to those workloads.

          Istio provides the ability to prevent network connectivity to external components by
          the use of authorization policies and service meshy things.

          Data Mining protection is available via istio by limiting the number of concurrent 
          connections by a user.  Additionally, the granular control of AuthorizationRules
          by istio on a path basis allow for control of how data can egress.

          Access Control decision is made by the Istio sidecar to determine if 
          AuthorizationPolicies apply to the requested traffic.

          Istio can be configured to ensure that only endpoints registered in the ServiceMesh
          are accessable by workloads.  Istio configurations in the istio-system namespace
          get applied globally to the cluster and provide a central configuration for acceess
          management
